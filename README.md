# Newsletter_Generator
üß† Use of AI Tools in the Development of the Project
Project: AI-Powered Personalized Newsletter Generator
Objective Recap
The goal of the project is to curate and deliver highly relevant and personalized news to users by analyzing articles from RSS feeds and matching them to individual user interests using AI techniques.

üîç AI Tools Used in the Project
1. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) ‚Äì for Text Representation
‚Ä¢	Tool Used: TfidfVectorizer from sklearn.feature_extraction.text
‚Ä¢	Purpose: Converts the textual content (titles and summaries of articles) into numerical vectors based on word importance.
‚Ä¢	How It Helps:
o	Allows the system to understand and quantify relevance between user-defined interests and the content of news articles.
o	Helps in identifying which articles are most significant for each user without hardcoded rules or manual tagging.

2. Cosine Similarity ‚Äì for Content Matching
‚Ä¢	Tool Used: cosine_similarity from sklearn.metrics.pairwise
‚Ä¢	Purpose: Measures the similarity between the user‚Äôs interest vector and each article‚Äôs vector.
‚Ä¢	How It Helps:
o	Enables the system to rank articles based on how closely they align with a user‚Äôs interests.
o	Provides a personalized recommendation score for each article, ensuring only the most relevant content is included in the newsletter.

üöÄ Contribution to Project Goals
AI Tool	Function in System	Contribution to Goals
TF-IDF	Transforms article text and user interests into comparable formats	Makes it possible to computationally evaluate relevance without manual tagging
Cosine Similarity	Calculates article-interest match score	Ensures each user receives a personalized and high-precision article selection

üß© Role in System Architecture
‚Ä¢	These tools serve as the core personalization engine.
‚Ä¢	By using vector space modeling and similarity scoring, the system avoids needing manually labeled datasets or supervised training.
‚Ä¢	This makes the system scalable, adaptable, and language-agnostic for many use cases and domains.

‚úÖ Alignment with Evaluation Criteria
Evaluation Criteria	How AI Tools Contribute
Code Quality	Modular use of sklearn tools makes the system clean and reusable
Ingenuity of Approach	Uses classical NLP techniques for intelligent filtering and relevance scoring
System Design	Decouples data collection, processing, and personalization‚Äîeasy to scale or enhance
Accuracy of Results	Vector similarity ensures that only articles matching user interests are prioritized

üß† Summary
The integration of TF-IDF and cosine similarity serves as a lightweight yet effective AI-based recommendation engine. These tools allow the system to intelligently filter, match, and rank content from RSS feeds based on user preferences, enabling accurate and automated personalized newsletters‚Äîall without the need for complex models or manual tagging.
